# Cover letter

This is me, Daniel Iván Romero Méndez. You can find all my features on this website. There are five plain web pages inside. Index show some intermittent pictures to make the website cozy to the user. There you can find links on the navigate panel to show who I am, and which projects I have done so far. Scrolling down you can find my two majors, by clicking one of them a window is deployed showing the main information of each one of my majors. You can navigate through all my information. Hope you will enjoy it.
